# 🚗 Car Parking Management Application (interview task)

## Overview

This project is a simple **Car Parking Management API** designed to demonstrate parking space management, fee calculation, and integration using a lightweight setup.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Open and compile** the solution in your IDE.
3. **Run** the `TdsCarParking.WebApi` project.
4. **Test the API** using the built-in **Swagger UI** interface.

## Notes

* The application uses an **in-memory database**, so no external setup or configuration is required.
* On startup, the car park is automatically seeded with **5 parking spaces** and predefined **charge rates**.
* **Integration tests** are not included to save time, but can easily be added if needed.

## Technologies Used

* .NET (C#)
* ASP.NET Core Web API
* Entity Framework Core (In-Memory Provider)
* Swagger / OpenAPI

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more *developer-portfolio friendly* (e.g., with a short “Purpose” or “Key Features” section)?
